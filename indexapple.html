                <p>Thank you Mr. Steve Jobs for changing our world in a supremely positive and exciting way like no

                    standard for all technology companies now and forever. God bless you, your wife, and your children.

                <h2>I'm Devastated</h2>
                <p>I'm a fan, follower, friend and lover of all things Apple. Steve Jobs was a hero to the geek in all
                    of us; a brilliant visionary who carried his convictions to completion. So sorry to hear he wasn't
                    able to beat his illness, the world has lost a bright flame, a voice who gave us so much. I have
                    been able to remain self employed in a home office because Steve Jobs gave me my freedom: with
                    computers and other innovations that are fast and easy to use. I fell in love with my first Mac and
                    I've never looked back. Steve Jobs changed the world and he will be missed. His fire burned out
                    today, but we will keep the flame burning with our loyalty and our hope for the future of Apple. And
                    in the end, it isn't about money, or things, or anything. My condolences to all of you who worked
                    with and knew this fearless leader.
                </p>

                <h2>RIP Steve Jobs</h2>
                <p>You save the whole world of technology, not only you created the macintosh, but also brought the
                    technology into a brand new world. You defined the true meaning of "personal computer." A great
                    innovator has fallen, but no one could ever ease you from our heart. I just want to cry out loud,
                    You saved the Apple, saved the technology, and saved the world. But yet no one can save you. Rest in
                    Peace Mr. Steve Jobs, the world will cry for you.
                </p>

                <p>Steve Jobs has been a great innovator just like Einstein or Alexander Graham Bell. His enormous
                    discoveries have inspired many people. Thank you for creating so many amazing gadgets... RIP Steve.

                <h2>Steve</h2>
                <p>I'm writing from Germany and it's pretty late here. I want to excuse my simple and bad english... I
                    just heard about the very sad news. Fans never kew their 'celebrities' personally, so like me. But I
                    feel for his Friends and his Family now. For me, he was a real genius. He changed the way how human
                    live. I mean, it's so unbelievable what we've done in the last Years. We (as the human species)
                    invented things, which are just magic! Thank you, Steve Jobs - for your work, for your enthusiasm,
                    for your visions... for your great keynotes. Just for everything! Me, and the world will never
                    forget you...

                <p>Dear Apple, Steve Jobs was a man, a husband, a father, an employer but above all a visionary and a
                    genius. He gave people hope, he gave people beliefs and through the plethora of iOS devices
                    produced, he gave people a sense of magic. Words wont express the sadness thousands and millions are
                    feeling but what we look forward to is the knowledge that Steve Jobs live in every Apple products
                    that were and will be produced.

                    members" as they mourn the loss of their admired founder as well. He absolutely made our modern-day

                <h2>Condolences</h2>
                <p>To All Who May Read This, I am very sorry for our loss. Steve Jobs was a pioneer in an industry that
                    needed men like him. His innovation and drive is what has made a miracle of modern technology so
                    easily taken for granted on a day to day basis. He was a man with passion for what he did and it
                    touched those that invest in and use Apple products everyday like myself. I can only hope that our
                    memories of him do him justice and that a piece of him lives on forever in Apple.
                </p>
